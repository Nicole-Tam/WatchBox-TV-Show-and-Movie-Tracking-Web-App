## <u><b>Context</b></u>
My Web App “WatchBox” is a tracking app for TV shows and Movies. It’s designed to help movie and TV show enthusiasts keep track of their content, and can be used to sort their current, past and future watching preferences. It serves as a digital diary for their viewing entertainment, allowing for users to maintain a record of their favourite movies and tv shows, ratings, descriptions, reviews, genres, watched and to watch. It’s suitable for all kinds of shows and movies, as well as people of all ages, due to it’s simplistic and user-centered design. “Watchbox” aims to help users seamlessly log and track their watch habits.

## Initial development
Firstly, I made the navigation bar, making sure the styles were all correct and the add content button was where I liked it. I utilised flex box to and justify-content: space-between; to make sure that they were symmetrically balanced. I used a CSS reset by Eric Meyer to reset default browser css styles and provide consistency across different browsers. I also added a language attribute for screen reader accessibility.

## ID's can be useful!
As seen below, I tried to get into the habit of always using either an ID or a class, depending on whether the object was unique or not, factoring potential future development. This was something I didn't do in previous units; sometimes I would only use classes because it felt easier to only rely on one method, but it's much easier looking through the css when items are categorised correctly!

However, this change did confuse me initially, because I kept changing the css properties of the logo, but it wouldn't change because I used the wrong selector...
